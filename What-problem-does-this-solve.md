windex was a project inspired by my frustration in using, (or more accurately, my love for hating windows). 

What problem does this  it solve?

Windows is an operating system that has
- no xdg specification
    Q: where do I configure? things
    A: wherever the program decided to put its config files
    Q: where is that?
    A: IDK, it depends on the program, and how the much developer wants to make you suffer.
  want to change a color to dark mode so it doesnt have the light of a thousand suns to burn your eyes out... too bad.

   They dont provide an option for that in the menu, which is the only way to configure anything...
you just have to find the right one, by playing cookie clicker on the advanced settings buttons...

 but good luck, theres like 50 of them, at varying lengths of age... because
nothing ever gets updated or improved, but instead it just gets layered on top of the same old crap.

 So you have to dig up 25 years worth of crap and old menus, to find the right one, before accidentally getting sent back to the "new and improved menu". 
 
 add to that, you know EXACTLY what you want to change... you know what program to change... you know that program must have a file to store its configuration...
 why not just edit that directly?...
 
 Because the color config is in a random file, in a random directory, with a random name, which is all completely undocumented...
 and the only hint of being related to the program is that it was opened by the program, which you can only see by tracing it?!


 

  and if you even think about changing a single color value. 
  it will crash ungrace-fullg on the next run... 
  delete all of its styling rules. and require you to completely reinstall the app, because... uh?
... reasons?
  
- no filesystem hierarchy standard
    - see the above issue, but actually it's the entire OS that does this
 and its not even consistent within itself?
 So, instead of JUST user files being disorganized, and looking worse than my desk...
 Its EVERYTHING, the entire thing?, its all just a mess... im surprised any of it works at all?

 basically it looks like it was made by an actual meth-addict


- no meaningful posix, unix or other-ix compliance
     just sort of off on its own... following none of the standards of practically every other operating system,
  including mac, linux, bsd, androids, embedded systems, smart TV's, routers, or literally any other device in the entire world?!
  including up to or beyond 70% of the internets underlying server infrastructure... 
  but somehow also demands that everyone conforms to their backwards way of doing everything,
  instead of the other way around... and im the weird one because I see this?
  
- no usefull and enjoyable shell

But what about powershell?
Exactly. Thats my point. 


- no composability
Another case of see the above point.

can i say one good thing about it? 
It's good for... video games that dont run on wine.
